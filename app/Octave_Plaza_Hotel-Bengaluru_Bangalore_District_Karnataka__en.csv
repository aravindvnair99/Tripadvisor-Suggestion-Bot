"A basic but surprisingly good no-nonsense 'business hotel' with a sensible and approachable staff, and accepts international credit cards. It is within walking distance of a grocery supermarket and next to a pharmacy. There are nearby food outlets, and food deliverers have no trouble finding the place.There are some technical issues with the elevator, new television and wi-fi, but these are easily accepted.",
Very nice Rooms. Good service. Hotel has no restaurant attached. How ever by order food is provided in the room. There are few restaurants near the lodge. Acceptable room rent in a modernised city. Good.,
"Rooms are ok. Cleaning and upkeep of bathroom are not good . Linen and towels are not usable. No water bottle provided but a common water dispenser in the corridor. Guests have to fill by them selves. No restaurant inside or nearby. Not even teashops in the locality. Hence, not good for long stay and not advisable for families as well.",
"Bugs were visible on the bedsheets and they crawl on the pillows, blankets and floor. Staff were friendly though. There is a market in the neighbourhood, convenient for shopping daily needs and for dining.",
Good place to stay and good location. Happy with all aspects of it and recommend it. Hope to visit again one day. When youâ€™re traveling you want s decent place to stay that is not far from the things you want to see and visit. Good enough location and nice room. ,
"We stayed at Octve Plaza Hotel, Bangalore for 2 nights on 31st August and 1st September 2018. We chose this hotel as it is quite decent and close to the Function hall where we have to attend a Marriage function. We booked 4 Superior Ac rooms through Make My Trip and got a decent price. The hotel is in a busy road, but once we enter inside its good. The rooms are spacious and can accomodate 3 people very comfortably. The rooms and bath rooms are very neat and clean and in bathroom Hot water is available 24 hours. Bathroom is also provided with hand wash, Soap and Shampoo dispensers and are of good quality. One thing we liked about this Hotel is the promptness of the front desk and staff in attending the requirements of the customers. The towels and bed sheets are very neat and clean. The hotel is quite near to the Gandhi Bazar, a busy business area.The drawbacks of this hotel are 1. No Parking, 2, No restaurant and 3, there is bad smell in the shop complex from where we have to enter the hotel and this fishy smell is some time felt in the lobby and corridors also. But once you enter room there is no smell.and the ambiance of the rooms is good. There is a Good restaurant just few buildings away and one can get Food from there, though we did not try. The rooms are provided with electric kettle and abundant supply of Coffee, tea, milk and sugar pouches. Over all this hotel is quite good for a short stay and very pocket friendly",
"I had booked well in advance the rooms for my guest who were visiting us in Bangalore. Knowing the problem of late check ins, i never wanted my relatives to face the problem and hence i had booked rooms from previous day itself. To my bad luck when i took them on next day the hotel front officer informed there is no rooms available and we need to wait till some check out happens. I had paid a full amount through the booking app and no way i was able to get back the money for the loss. The front officer will behave as if it is our fault and he is nowhere connected for not giving the rooms.Being a Bangalorean i faced this attitude from staffs. Outside visitors please note.YOU ARE MOST UNWELCOME HERE.",
The Octave Plaza was a nice clean hotel in a good area. Enjoyed my stay there and the surrounding area. The Ramakrishna ashram is near plus lots of old temples. The Ganesh one is around the corner. Best dosas just down the street.,
