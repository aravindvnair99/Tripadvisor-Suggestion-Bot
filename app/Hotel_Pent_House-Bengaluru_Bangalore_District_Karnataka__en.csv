"Good:- Hospitality was good.- Rooms were clean.Need Improvement:- No proper parking space.- We didn't get tea in the morning.- Since the hotel is located in the mid of a pub-area, not suggested if you go there by Friday night, you might get trapped in heavy traffic.",

"located in koramangala, in the busiest most bustling centre of town, this property is an easy option if you need a place to crash. its better than basic, as the place is relatively clean, decent beds, and a decent bath. dont expect any frills, and at the price point that they operate you would be foolish if you do anyways! food was not on the house in our reservation and honestly you dont need it. There's a million places on the street just outside, and even more delivering food to your door. Just use zomato or swiggy, and youre all set. some rooms might have their own quirks. for example, the first room i used had a hot water system that i could not figure out for the life of me. hot water comes out no matter which direction you turn the faucet in, and there is no switch, knob or regulator of any sort to even turn off the hot water. to make matters worse, hot water even comes out of the health faucet!!! and unlike the bath, i dont have an option to mix cold water here now, do I!! suffice it to say, i'm reducing the one star just because of bum burns - literally! the second room had a bath that was designed poorly - structurally! If you open the bathroom door all the way, it bangs the shower area glass separator. if youre unlucky, you could cause some damage to it, or worse, to yourself! Plus, all bathrooms are a step up from the living space in the room. somehow, the weird rhombus shape of this bath made it so that if youre not careful stepping in, you'll bang your head on the towel rack on the left! Maybe shorter people wouldnt have that issue, but i did, and i'm just barely 6 ft!why did i need two rooms? cause we were arriving late and my reservation was for a king bed, and inspite of calling them and telling them of our delay, they gave up our room to someone else, and gave me and my wife a room with 2 single beds. So we had to move rooms the next day once another room freed up.maybe you'll think im being generous then, with my 3/5 rating. but im not. like i said, its good. just not very good. especially at the price point and segment they operate in.",
"When it comes to hotels I am not a fussy traveler. What I look for is cleanliness, bathroom with plenty of hot water and convenient location. As easy access to St John’s Medical College in Bangalore was one of my priorities I chose the Pent House hotel (10 minutes rhikshaw ride costing 40 rupees (eight hundred rupees to reach the airport by taxi). The hotel met all of my expectations. Several small restaurants in the area and a drink bar across the street guarantee that hotel guests will not be confined to their rooms in the evening. Very modest Indian style breakfast is available in a small café (in the same building) if you book a room with breakfast but the restaurants in the neighbourhood offer a much more exciting menu. The unexpected problem which I encountered was finding the place. The small map on the reservation sheet and on hotel’s business card did not mean much even to local rhikshaw and taxi drivers. What helped was a photo of the hotel and of the Hyderabad Biryaani House – a good restaurant located in the same building. You can also mention a larger Empire International Hotel located about 100 yards along the same street. Other features: reasonably priced, TV with Indian channels, Wi-Fi, lift, very friendly staff. The security box in my room did not work but I did not really need it. Summing up – not a bad choice for a short stay in the Koramangala part of Bangalore.",
Nice rooms & service. No issues at all.located at the heart of the city. Pleasure staying here. Everything is available without any interruptionRoom service & staffs are very co-operative. Preferably suggestive to look here anytime.,
"THE HOTEL IS CENTRALLY LOCATED @ KORAMANGALAReasonably priced,value for money.Good staff,neat and clean rooms.Koramangala is very posh area and this hotel is ion a ONEWAY.But good hotel for family stay.",
"It’s On a one way street. If you miss it, you will have to go in circles.Car parking? Just for two cars. Behind the hotel. You have to take a roundabout to reach there by car.Mosquitos in the room. Poor hot water quality. Narrow soft beds. Take care that you don’t fall. Done if you have a weak back. Power goes and comes. Weak Wifi need to be logged in every time. Doesn’t let you see whatsup.Breakfast in room. Limited to dosas, idlis, tea. A bottle of water complimentary. A towel for two. There’s a kettle and tea cups too. No tea sachets. Toiletries minimal. Token soap, a shampoo. No hand towel. Elders need to be careful bathing as there is nothing to hold on and floor may be slippery. Nothing to hang clothes in bathroom.Positives. Spacious room. Responsive hospitality. Restaurants around.",
"I stayed with my wife for 3 nights here... It was really comfortable.. staff were very professional especially Amit, Faisal and Reka.. they took care of everything... And the rooms were well maintained and clean.. they won't say no to anything you request.... Rates were reasonable too... I will visit again... Thank you everyone for the wonderful service...",
"My stay in Penthouse Hotel was extremely comfortable mainly because the hotel is on one of the most buzzing streets of Koramangala with more than 30 restaurants within a walking range of 5 mins. Also, the hotel staff was extremely friendly and hospitable. The hotel rooms were very neat and clean too with attention to detail.",
"I wanted somewhere in Kormangala that was central but affordable. Hotel Penthouse met those critera, I was pleasantly surprised how clean it was and how helpful/nice all the staff were. I had a room at the back on the first floor so it was quiet. Breakfast included but no restaurant IN the hotel. This is not a problem since there are at least 20 good value restaurants within 5 minutes walk (including a Briyani place on the ground floor of the building) so you are spoilt for choice.",
"The location of this hotel is superb, atleast for my work it was, right in the middle of Koramangala with so many good food joints / pubs / clubs just at walking distances The room was super clean and cozy,Breakfast was served in the room which was superb too,The staff at the reception were helpful and polite Would definitely stay here again ",
"I stayed at this hotel along with my family for two weeks from 29th April 2017. It is a well maintained hotel at a good locality. Rooms are very spacious. The front office staff members, particularly Mr Faisal, Mr Abhishek, Mr Jobi, Mr Aziz etc. were very helpful and hospitable. The supporting staff members were also very cordial. I would love to stay at this hotel again during my next visit to Bangalore.",
"Very well maintained, close by to good restaurants & public places, just next to hosur Road which makes easy to Electronic city, corporate people who want a budget hotel & close to electronic City can definitely go for this hotel.",
